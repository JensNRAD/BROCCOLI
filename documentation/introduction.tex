\section{Introduction}

BROCCOLI is a software mainly created for analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The major advantage of BROCCOLI, compared to other software packages, is that it is much faster. The main reason for this is that BROCCOLI is written in OpenCL (Open Computing Language), making it possible to run the analysis in parallel on a large variety of hardware platforms (such as CPUs, Nvidia GPUs and AMD GPUs). 

\section{Downloading BROCCOLI}

BROCCOLI is available as open source at https://github.com/wanderine/BROCCOLI/. For Linux and Mac computers, the following git command can be used to download BROCCOLI into the folder BROCCOLI. 

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/wanderine/BROCCOLI.git BROCCOLI
\end{verbatim}

For Windows computers, see https://windows.github.com/ or download BROCCOLI as a zip file from github. 

\section{Installing OpenCL}

BROCCOLI requires that at least one OpenCL driver is installed. All hardware platforms (e.g. Intel, AMD and Nvidia) require a specific OpenCL driver. It is possible to install several OpenCL drivers on a single machine.

Intel drivers are currently located at \\ https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opencl-drivers. 

AMD drivers can be found at http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/opencl-zone/opencl-tools-sdks/amd-accelerated-parallel-processing-app-sdk/. 

Nvidia drivers can be found at http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx. Note that a driver for an Nvidia graphics cards includes an OpenCL driver. 

\section{Compiling the BROCCOLI library}

BROCCOLI is written as a C++/OpenCL library, such that it can be linked to a number of softwares. To compile the BROCCOLI library on a Linux computer, the following command
can be used from the folder BROCCOLI/code/BROCCOLI\_LIB (where BROCCOLI denotes where you saved BROCCOLI from github).

\begin{verbatim}
 ./compile_broccoli_library.sh 
\end{verbatim}

Note that you may need to edit compile\_broccoli\_library.sh to point to a directory which contains opencl.h. For Mac, a similar bash script exists

\begin{verbatim}
 ./compile_broccoli_library_mac.sh 
\end{verbatim}

On Windows computers, the BROCCOLI library can for example be compiled using Microsoft Visual Studio. Visual Studio project files are available in BROCCOLI/code/BROCCOLI\_LIB. 

\section{Compiling the bash wrappers}

It is possible to run BROCCOLI in a number of ways, for example from a Matlab terminal or from a Python terminal. The fMRI software packages AFNI and FSL can be launched from a Linux terminal, and BROCCOLI includes a bash wrapper for this purpose. The bash wrapper functions first need to be compiled, and the following command can be used from the folder BROCCOLI/code/Bash\_Wrapper

\begin{verbatim}
 ./compile_wrappers.sh 
\end{verbatim}

Similarly, the following command can be used for Mac

\begin{verbatim}
 ./compile_wrappers_mac.sh 
\end{verbatim}

Since BROCCOLI uses the NIfTI library to read NIfTI files, it may be necessary to first compile the NIfTI library, by running Make in the folder BROCCOLI/code/Bash\_Wrapper/nifticlib-2.0.0.


\section{Checking the OpenCL drivers}

To check the installation of the OpenCL driver(s), the function GetOpenCLInfo can be used. It lists all the available devices for each OpenCL platform. The following output is from a computer with three OpenCL drivers (Intel, AMD, Nvidia) and one Intel CPU (with 32 GB of memory), one AMD graphics card (3 GB of memory) and one Nvidia graphics card (6 GB of memory). For each bash function, it is easy to select which platform and which device to use. Note that the Intel CPU can be used with the Intel platform or the AMD platform.

\section{Selecting the OpenCL platform and device}

As mentioned previously, it is easy to select which OpenCL platform and device to use for each BROCCOLI function (the default platform and device is 0). For each bash function, the option -platform sets the OpenCL platform to use, and the option -device sets the device to use. The first level analysis can, for example, be performed using platform 1 and device 1 by using the command

\begin{verbatim}
./FirstLevelAnalysis fMRI.nii T1.nii BrainTemplate.nii ...
 regressors.txt contrasts.txt -platform 1 -device 1
\end{verbatim}
	
For the test computer used in the introduction, this means that the analysis runs on the Intel CPU using the AMD platform. By changing the device to 0, the AMD graphics card will instead be used. 

\section{Compiling the OpenCL kernel code}

The file broccoli\_lib\_kernel.cpp contains all the OpenCL code that runs on the selected device. The first time BROCCOLI uses a specific device, it has to compile all the OpenCL code to a form that can be used by the device. For this reason, the first function call will take more time. The compiled code will however be saved as a binary file, such that BROCCOLI can simply read the compiled code for all subsequent function calls. For our specific test computer, BROCCOLI will produce the following binary files

\begin{verbatim}
broccoli_lib_kernel_Intel_Intel(R)Core(TM)i7-3770KCPU@3.50GHz.bin
broccoli_lib_kernel_AMD_Intel(R)Core(TM)i7-3770KCPU@3.50GHz.bin 
broccoli_lib_kernel_AMD_Tahiti.bin
broccoli_lib_kernel_Nvidia_GeForceGTXTITAN.bin
\end{verbatim}
